# Encryption: the knapsack problem
Windows Form application code for encrypting text using knapsack problem methods (Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem)

## ABOUT
Programming language: C#

For my classmates!

## Conditions of the problem
:white_check_mark: the encryption code and the private key are saved in different files

:white_check_mark: there is a check for the correctness of the private key values, n, m, n^-1

:white_check_mark: during decryption, the ciphergram and public key can be generated or taken from the files

Скиньте деняг :(
